            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

                    Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail.
